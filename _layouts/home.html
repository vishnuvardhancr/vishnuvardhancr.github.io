<h2 class="archive__subtitle">{{ site.data.ui-text[site.locale].about_me | default: "About me" }}</h2>
<p style="font-size:18px; text-align: justify; width: 700px;"> I received the B. E. (Hons.) degree in electronics and communications engineering from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS) Pilani, India, in 2013. I graduated top of my class in the department of Electrical Engineering at BITS and was awarded the institute Silver medal for being ranked second in the whole institute. After my graduation, I worked as a design engineer at Redpine Signals Inc. for two years. I received the M. S. and Ph. D. degree from the Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech in 2020. I was also a recipient of the Pratt scholarship at Virginia Tech and BITS merit scholarship for excellence in academics. I have held internship positions at Philips Research India, Bangalore, Qualcomm Research Center, San Diego, and Nokia Bell Labs, Murray Hill. I am currently employed at Qualcomm, San Diego, in the position of Senior engineer in the wireless standards team.</p>
